&lt;p&gt;I am obssessed with digital games since I was 5 years old. That means I&amp;rsquo;ve already played games over the past 30 years. Now I have a 9 years old son, I sometimes watch him playing his favorate games. To be honest, I am so envy on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to work, work, and work. When I finally got sometime, I just unlock my cellphone, swiping the glass. No, that&amp;rsquo;s not a gamer. A gamer should sit down or sink down the coach, holding his controller, and playing the game from day to night. That is me, that&amp;rsquo;s the devotion I am always seeking for.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
