&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things just faded away, not like Michael Jordan, like a duck drone in the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had many excuses not update my blog for such a long time. But I need to say, when you didn&amp;rsquo;t put much effort on something, it just faded away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t realized that Hugo is under heavy development, and many themes are also evolving. So I decided to give it a try again. Last time I deployed my blog on github pages, it has a very very ugly layout. This time I found a very nice theme called &lt;a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-diary/"&gt;diary&lt;/a&gt;, and I really like it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
