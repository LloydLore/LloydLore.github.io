&lt;p&gt;This document provides a solution for configuring VSCode to use monospace fonts where Chinese (CJK) characters occupy exactly twice the width of English characters, ensuring proper alignment in mixed-language text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working with mixed Chinese and English text in VSCode, proper character alignment is crucial for code comments, documentation, and text formatting. True monospace fonts should maintain a 2:1 width ratio between full-width CJK characters and half-width Latin characters.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Playing Game with Myself</title><link>https://lloydlore.github.io/posts/playing-games-with-myself/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lloydlore.github.io/posts/playing-games-with-myself/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="no-games-for-a-long-time"&gt;No Games for a Long Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am obssessed with digital games since I was 5 years old. That means I&amp;rsquo;ve already played games over the past 30 years. Now I have a 9 years old son, I sometimes watch him playing his favorate games. To be honest, I am so envy on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to work, work, and work. When I finally got sometime, I just unlock my cellphone, swiping the glass. No, that&amp;rsquo;s not a gamer. A gamer should sit down or sink down the coach, holding his controller, and playing the game from day to night. That is me, that&amp;rsquo;s the devotion I am always seeking for.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Long time no tweaking Hugo</title><link>https://lloydlore.github.io/posts/my-new-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lloydlore.github.io/posts/my-new-post/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="not-a-welcome"&gt;Not A Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things just faded away, not like Michael Jordan, like a duck drone in the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had many excuses not update my blog for such a long time. But I need to say, when you didn&amp;rsquo;t put much effort on something, it just faded away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t realized that Hugo is under heavy development, and many themes are also evolving. So I decided to give it a try again. Last time I deployed my blog on github pages, it has a very very ugly layout. This time I found a very nice theme called &lt;a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-diary/"&gt;diary&lt;/a&gt;, and I really like it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
