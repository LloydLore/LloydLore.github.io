## No Games for a Long Time

I am obssessed with digital games since I was 5 years old. That means I've already played games over the past 30 years. Now I have a 9 years old son, I sometimes watch him playing his favorate games. To be honest, I am so envy on him. 

I have to work, work, and work. When I finally got sometime, I just unlock my cellphone, swiping the glass. No, that's not a gamer. A gamer should sit down or sink down the coach, holding his controller, and playing the game from day to night. That is me, that's the devotion I am always seeking for. 

## Work or Play, this is the problem

In my journey with games, I came across some games I just hard to swallow, I would play until I finally got tired of the tedious game. Now it turns to my work, I hate what I am doing when I sit down in my office chair. I feel distracted from everything except the work presented to my face. That is not a good sign, I am dreaming to quit the job and start my own business. One day I suddenly got the idea: if I am going to start my own business, could the easy attempt of distraction could do me well?

The answer is absolutely NO. I feel ashamed at that moment. Does the notion of "start my own business" is a blind confidence I used to escape the reality? The answer is absolutely YES. 

## If I Really Want

If I really want to start my own business, just don't waste the time when sitting in the office. Distraction is by no means a good thing, if I don't like the job, just wait for the apporiate timing, then quit this fucking job. But before that moment, I should play the game, the tedious game. 

Pull my attention back.
