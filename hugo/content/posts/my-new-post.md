# Not A Welcome

> Things just faded away, not like Michael Jordan, like a duck drone in the ocean.

I had many excuses not update my blog for such a long time. But I need to say, when you didn't put much effort on something, it just faded away.

I didn't realized that Hugo is under heavy development, and many themes are also evolving. So I decided to give it a try again. Last time I deployed my blog on github pages, it has a very very ugly layout. This time I found a very nice theme called [diary](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-diary/), and I really like it.

But since long time has elapsed, I need to re-learn how to set up a blog using Hugo. So I decided to write down my experience here, so that I can refer to it later.

## 4 days journey

I stayed up for 2:00 a.m. on the day yesterday just in order to make some trial and error to make this little project work. By that night I closed my eyes, I finished successful build on my local environment, but as you know, I don't have much confidence to make it work with the Github actions. 

I felt a little bit tired of Hugo from the next morning. I indeed wanted to master Hugo, but I tried several times, it is so unfamiliar to me. I don't use Go previsouly, I was astonished by the Go grammer I encountered. Then day 2, and day 3 passed away easily. At current stage, it is the 4th day when I started this refactoring. 

I need to finish them today, I just told myself with such sentence. 

## Delete the memories

I deleted all the content I made with previous Hugo Setup. I build a org-mode worflow at that time, but somehow I didn't insisted on with org-mode. I shall say this is the first time over these years I want to give Markdown a serious try instead of keep myself on orgmode. I know it might sound strange to some wierdo (hacker, and geek maybe), but I really think I don't use much orgmode features over the past years. 

It doesn't mean that I will give up orgmode. God, I love orgmode, it is one of the most powerful tools in the world. All I wanted to say is that, orgmode is the very part I cannot let go. So let's see what I could do with it next steps. 

## In the fu...ture

I try not to think about the future, I need to focus on the moment.
