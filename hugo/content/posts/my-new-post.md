# Not A Welcome

> Things just faded away, not like Michael Jordan, like a duck drone in the ocean.

I had many excuses not update my blog for such a long time. But I need to say, when you didn't put much effort on something, it just faded away.

I didn't realized that Hugo is under heavy development, and many themes are also evolving. So I decided to give it a try again. Last time I deployed my blog on github pages, it has a very very ugly layout. This time I found a very nice theme called [diary](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-diary/), and I really like it.

But since long time has elapsed, I need to re-learn how to set up a blog using Hugo. So I decided to write down my experience here, so that I can refer to it later.

## What I'll Cover

In this post, I'll walk you through:

- Setting up Hugo
- Configuring the diary theme
- Creating your first post
- Customizing the layout

Let's get started!

So where is the iamge?

## Installation

First, you'll need to install Hugo...
